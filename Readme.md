# Paytm Website clone

 Hello, My name is __Pratik Dhande__
I created Paytm Website clone using Html and Tailwind.css. It's my 16th project given as an assignment in **_Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp  Live Class_**. this project is totally created using tailwind css and this website is Responsive too,i used flex, grid and combination of both in some parts of this project,  i have faced lot difficulties while making it responsive. though it was fun and i learned more new things about tailwind css.
